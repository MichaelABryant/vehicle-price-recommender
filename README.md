# Project 2: Vehicle Sales Price Prediction (Python)

This repository is for the analysis and modeling done on the Kaggle: Vehicle Sales dataset. Below you will find an overview of the data, code, and results. The goal of this project was to create an end-to-end project where I perform an exploratory data analysis, prepare the data (i.e., clean and feature engineer), apply machine learning algorithms to predict the sales price of vehicles, and create a [deployed application with a front end](https://predict-vehicle-price.herokuapp.com/) to [productionize the best performing model](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/vehicle-price-pred-app).

### Code Used 

**Python Version:** 3.8.11 <br />
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, flask, statsmodels, shap, eli5  <br />
**For Web Framework Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  

## Vehicle Sales Dataset

The dataset was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho). The dataset contains 8 variables and 301 vehicle sales records.

### Variables

`Car_Name`, `Year`, `Selling_Price`, `Present_Price`, `Kms_Driven`, `Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, `Transmission`, `Owner`

## Files

### vehicle-sales-eda-cleaning.py

### vehicle-sales-modeling.py

### vehicle-sales-final-model.py

### Data Cleaning

I cleaned the data to make the dataset usable for future modeling. I made the following changes:

### Featured Engineering

I feature engineered using the dataset for future modeling. I made the following changes:
