This repository is for the analysis and modeling done on the Kaggle: Vehicle Sales dataset. Below you will find an overview of the data, code, and results. The goal of this project was to create and end-to-end project where I perform an exploratory data analysis, prepare the data (i.e., clean and feature engineer), apply machine learning algorithms to predict the sales price of vehicles, and create a deployed application to productionize the model.

### Code Used 

**Python Version:** 3.7.10 <br />
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, warnings<br />
**For Web Framework Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  

## Vehicle Sales Dataset

The dataset was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho). The dataset contains 8 variables and 301 vehicle sales records.

### Variables

## vehicle-sales-eda-cleaning.py

## vehicle-sales-modeling.py

## vehicle-sales-final-model.py

### Data Cleaning

I cleaned the data to make the dataset usable for future modeling. I made the following changes:

### Featured Engineering

I feature engineered using the dataset for future modeling. I made the following changes:
